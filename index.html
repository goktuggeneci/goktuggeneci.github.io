    <h1>Should we avoid Electronic-Cigarettes?<h1>
	   <p>    Electronic-Cigarettes more known as” E-Cigarettes”, “E-Cigs” or “Vapes” are a growing trend around the nation. An E-Cigarettes are an alternative for consuming nicotine, the chemical found in tobacco that makes it addicting. It is a common belief that these devices are harmless because it is believed that all the device does is create harmless vapor. While this is not the case these vapors contain chemicals that are harmful to the human body. People need to be more aware of what they are consuming and acknowledging the harms and risks of using E-Cigarettes. Even though e-cigs are a healthier alternative to smoking they could still cause some serious health issues that could be avoided.<p>
       <h2>What are E-Cigarettes?<h2>
         <p>    E-Cigarettes are battery based devices that convert a liquid that contains and flavoring into vapor that the user inhales. They are usually pen shaped; the user inhales the vaporized liquid from one end the devise. These liquids contain nicotine, glycol, glycerin, propylene, and flavorings. E-Cigarettes don’t leave a mess like traditional cigarettes due, they do not produce ash or that smoky smell that tobacco leaves. Instead it releases a scented mist of the users choosing. Some use E-Cigarettes because they say it is a healthier alternative to smoking and even reduce their “smokers cough”. <p>
           <p>    The inventor of the electronic cigarette was a Chinese pharmacist Hon Lik, who patented it in 2003. The following year Lik introduced the electronic cigarette to the Chinese market. While numerous companies are taking great interest in this product as are many consumers around the world. Smoking an E-Cigarette or “vaping” is getting significantly popular, raising concerns regarding health risks like the possibility that the vapor being created by the device contains harmful chemicals.<p>
             <p>    “The lithium battery powers the e-cigarette and can be charged using a charger similar to those used for cell phone batteries. The charged battery is connected to the vaporization chamber, a hollow tube that contains electronic controls and an atomizer -- the component that creates the vapor. Before the user activates the device, he or she attaches a cartridge containing nicotine liquid to the vaporization chamber. The tip of the cartridge serves as the e-cigarette's mouthpiece.” –Cassidy.<p>

  <h2>Why E-Cigarettes Over Traditional Cigarettes? <h2>
    <p>     There are many ways of consuming tobacco. Besides form just smoking traditional cigarettes people often chew tobacco, smoke cigars, smoke out pipes, smoke hookahs, and multiple other ways. All of which involve consuming the tobacco one way or another creating an addiction. Even though it may not contain tobacco, E-Cigarettes are considered a technique of smoking. Most older users of E-Cigarettes use these devices so they can quit smoking traditional cigarettes. These are extremely useful for quitting tobacco cigarettes because the addicting chemical in tobacco, nicotine, is used in the making of e-fluids (fluid used in E-Cigarettes) so it satisfies the users chemical addiction. While satisfying their addiction it also gives the feeling of smoking which truly makes the user feel like they have smoked. E-Cigarettes give the feeling of smoking do to their shape, size, and appearance. The tubular shape of the device and the light emitting diode (LED) that are usually on the device give the feeling of a burning cigarette. In addition to the satisfaction of smoking, e-fluid contains a flavor of the user’s choice. These fluids can go from fruity to any kind of taste or smell, they can even be cigarette flavored specific to cigarette brand. <p>
      <h2>Teen Smoking<h2>
        <p>“A recent study by the CDC and the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) found that, between 2013 and 2014, e-cigarette use in middle and high school students tripled. While that in and of itself is troubling, another study found that e-cigarettes are frequently a gateway product; teens who have tried e-cigs or vape pens more than twice as likely to start smoking traditional cigarettes than those who haven’t.
The primary reason for this progression is the similarities between the chemical content of e-cigs/vape pens and traditional cigarettes. The main ingredient in e-cigarettes and vape pens (and the reason why users keep coming back for more) is the nicotine content, which is extremely addictive and can have numerous negative health consequences.
While nicotine alone is an inherently harmful drug, the effects on teenagers are magnified exponentially. According to CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H., “Adolescence is a critical time for brain development. Nicotine exposure at a young age may cause lasting harm to brain development, promote addiction, and lead to sustained tobacco use.”   (pridesurveys)

  <h2>Harms and Health Risks of Using E-Cigarettes<h2>
    <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has joined other health experts to warn consumers about potential health risks associated with electronic cigarettes.
Some concerns of the agency are that. Using e-cigarettes can make a user such as young people less aware of the amount of nicotine they are consuming. Unknowing consuming large amounts of nicotine can increase addiction amongst users and may lead to increased consumption of tobacco products, which are known to cause disease.
<p>
  <p>“The potential health risks posed by the use of e-cigarettes were addressed in a July 22, 2009, phone conference between Joshua M. Sharfstein, M.D., principal deputy commissioner of food and drugs; Jonathan Winickoff, M.D., chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Tobacco Consortium; Jonathan Samet, M.D., director of the University of Southern California's Institute for Global Health; and Matthew T. McKenna, M.D., director of the Office on Smoking and Health at the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.” (FDA official website)<p>
    <p>The participants in the conference stressed that parents should warn their teens about excessive nicotine usage leading to addiction. Another concern is that e-fluids are sold in all sorts of flavors which seems appealing to a younger crowd. Findings were made towards the harmful chemicals in these fluids such as diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical found in antifreeze. Several other samples that contain carcinogens, including nitrosamines were also found.<p>
      <p>Tests by researchers were conducted exposing lung tissue grown on a dish to nicotine found in both in cigarette smoke and in e fluids. Researchers revealed that nicotine caused inflammation to the lung tissue, also reducing the tissues ability to protect itself from foreign material. The head of the research team, Irina Petrache, a doctor and lung specialist at Indiana University in Indianapolis and her group “showed for the first time that nicotine, whatever its source, can harm lung tissue. So in this respect, her team now concludes, vaping would be no better for the lungs than cigarette smoking.”. but even if e fluids without nicotine is used lung tissue still had its barrier function disturbed, Petrache’s team says “. The scientists suspect it may have to do with solvents and other potentially toxic materials. These chemicals are present in the flavored liquids that are inhaled through e-cigarettes.”. It is also seen that longer exposure to this can cause cells to be more vulnerable to germs and bacteria.<p>
        <p>“In that study, mice inhaled e-cigarette vapors for two weeks. Their lungs showed signs of inflammation. Later, these animals were exposed either to Staphylococcus or to flu virus. Mice with inflamed lungs were less able to fight off infection than were mice that had not vaped. Some vaping mice even died from the flu. All nonvaping mice survived.” (Raloff, Mole)<p>
          <p>Research was also done on a small group of people. After collection data from the participants that smoke tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes found that both seem to have the same short term effects on lungs. These findings were reported by scientists on July 1, 2014 issue of Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology.<p>
            <p>“Recently, scientists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill exposed human lung cells to 13 e-cigarette flavorings. Exposures lasted either 30 minutes or a full day. Five of the flavorings — hot cinnamon candies, banana pudding, kola, vanilla and menthol tobacco — affected the cells. Sometimes the treated cells no longer could replicate (reproduce) at normal rates. At high doses, these flavorings even killed the cells.”. (Raloff, Mole)<p>
              <h2>What to Do Instead of Smoking and Benefits<h2>
                <p>If you are trying to find an alternative to smoking here is your best option. The best thing to do instead of smoking is not smoking altogether. Everything related to smoking whether it be using tobacco or vaping has its harms. If you are looking to e cigarettes as an alternative to smoking here are the benefits of quitting smoking.<p>
                  <p>Within the first day to quitting your heartrate will drop back to normal levels, your blood pressure will get closer to normal levels, and your blood movement will start to improve. Even though you are not yet rid of all of the risks you decrease your chances of getting coronary artery disease which leads to heart disease and is one of the leading causes of death in the united states, according to the National Heart, Lung, and blood Institute.<p>
                    <p>Not smoking for over a day sharpens a person’s sense of smell, taste and even improve sleeping habits, due to nerve endings beginning to regrow and restore your senses. After a few days your body will completely rid from your body. This may cause some physical and mental side effects of withdrawal. These side effects include headaches, Nausea, cramps, sweating, anxiety, irritability, depression. This is one of the more difficult parts of quitting but if you can make it past this part you’re are on a good path and it only gets easier from here on out. Within a couple weeks your body will be able to excursive without getting tired as easily and your lungs will begin to clear allowing to be able to take a bigger breath and breath more comfortably.<p>
                      <p>“After one month without cigarettes, the cilia inside your lungs will begin to repair. The cilia are the tiny, hair-like structures that push mucus out of the lungs. Once the cilia are able to do their job efficiently, they can fight off infection and clear the lungs more easily. With properly functioning lungs, your coughing and shortness of breath will continue to decrease dramatically.” (Wolfson)<p>
                        <p>Along with this your withdrawal symptoms will be gone completely depending on how heavy of a smoker you were before you quitted. After that your body is just fully recovering from what smoking has caused your body and within five to fifteen years it will have the same health risk odds as nonsmokers.<p>
